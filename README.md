# hello-world
My very first repository on GitHub.  Could this be the beginning of something great?

We shall soon see what my future has in store on GitHub.  I am excited to get started, but first. a little about me:
My name is Jacob Walters and I am from Cincinnati, Ohio.  Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University.
My focus areas include Graphics and Game design, and Artificial Intellegence.
